/* Rilla’s solution to exercise 9.7 of Daniel Shiffman’s Nature of Code

Exercise 9.7
Rewrite the fitness function to increase exponentially according to the number of correct characters. Note that you will also have to normalize the fitness values to a range between 0 and 1 so they can be added to the mating pool a reasonable number of times. */

   int numCorrect = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i < genes.length; i++) {
      if (genes[i] == target.charAt(i)) {

   }
   fitness = numCorrect*numCorrect;
   fitness = map(fitness, 0, genes.length*genes.length, 0, 1);
